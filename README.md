# Elizabeth-RandomPWGenerator

Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code.

It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This app will create a random password based on the user-selected criteria which includes: 

    1. The length of the password between the range of 8 and 128. 
       *The user will be asked how many characters they prefer their password to be. 

    2. If the user wants to include upper case letters in their password
        *The user will be presented with a prompt to confirm if they prefer to have upper case letters in their password.

    3. If the user wants to include lower case letters in their password
        *The user will be presented with a prompt to confirm if they prefer to have lower case letters in their password.

    4. If the user wants to include numbers in their password
        *The user will be presented with a prompt to confirm if they prefer to have numbers in their password.

    5. If the user wants to include special characters in their password
        *The user will be presented with a prompt to confirm if they prefer to have special characters in their password.

Once all these prompts are confirmed, the user should click "Generate Password" and a random password tailored to their specifications will show. 

The password will be generated based on these parameters which is done with a function which includes variables for criteria listed above, confirm prompts, validation for confirms, a for loop to repeat the action specified by the user's input, and return the result to call the function.
