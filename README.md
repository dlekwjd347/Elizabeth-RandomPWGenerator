# Elizabeth-RandomPWGenerator

This app will create a random password based on the user-selected criteria which includes: 

    1. The length of the password between the range of 8 and 128.

    2. If the user wants to include upper case letters in their password

    3. If the user wants to include lower case letters in their password

    4. If the user wants to include numbers in their password

    5. If the user wants to include special characters in their password


The password will be generated based on these parameters which is done with a function which includes variables for criteria listed above, confirm prompts, validation for confirms, a for loop to repeat the action specified by the user's input, and return the result to call the function.
